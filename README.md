#  This is still in development at the moment - Check back soon! 

Hi! I am a full stack web developer with a passion for interactive client side web experiences! 

I enjoy building with modern frameworks, APIs, CMS and any available tools that allow for engaging web applications.

I'm currently working as a media producer and web developer at <a href="http://haply.co" target="_blank">Haply Robotics</a>. 
Bellow you can see some of some of my favorite web projects:

<br/>

<p align="left"> Is it a good idea to build a text editor "from scratch" as an early web development project? I wouldn't recommend it. </p>

<p align="left"> Was it a great challenge and formative to my experience as a developper? Absolutely.
</p>

### Notable features: 
- Rendering and data management of text editor
- Save and load project file locally or to MongoDB

Walk around my virtual art exhibit! A chaotic representation of the spaces, videos and pieces of art I have created through my life.

*** Apologies for lag... it is quite a heavy project without many optimzations.

<h3> Cards </h3>

<br/>
<br/>
<p text-align="right" align="left" height="200px"> 
  An app that lets you create note cards and save them for later.
</p>
<p> Drag and drop functionality has always been a fun one that I enjoy. 
</p>
<p>

I once created an NPM package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dragset" >react-dragset </a> that allows any element that is a direct child of the package's provided DragContainer to be moved around on the screen by the user!
</p>
  *** You'll notice that I did not use react-dragset package in this app though... as I can no longer update or maintain the package because of frustratingly lost 2FA credentials...
