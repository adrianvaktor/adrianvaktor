Hi! I am a full stack web developer with a passion for interactive client side web experiences! I love building with modern frameworks, APIs, CMS and any available tools that enhance and allow for engaging web applications.

I'm currently working as a media producer and web developer at <a href="http://haply.co" target="_blank">Haply Robotics</a>. 
Bellow you can see some of some of my favorite web projects:
